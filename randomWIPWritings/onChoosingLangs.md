Its so easy to get caught up in the perceived merits of a language, but the reality is that most popular languages are
powerful enough to do any job, thats why they are popular. Python, PHP, Ruby etc are all going to be around for quite
sometime.

What usually makes or breaks a language's suitability for a given type of project is the ecosystem and community surrounding
that language. Sure you can build a social blogging platform with ROR, but the social blogging community developing on ROR is
a small percentage of say Wordpress for example. So with that in mind, you have to ask the following.

1. Where is the Ruby/Rails community headed?

and

2. Is where Ruby/Rails heading going to be relevant to me?

The question is, will the future of ROR be relevant to the clients and projects you are and will be working on? If you are
developing the average multi page mostly static CMS site and blog for your everyday client, then ROR is not and will probably
never be more relevant to you than PHP is. PHP does and for the foreseeable future will dominate blogging and CMS. Projects
like Wordpress, Drupal etc are getting bigger not smaller.
