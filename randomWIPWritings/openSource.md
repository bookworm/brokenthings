# Intro

Recently OSM handed down a decision in regards to licenses on the JED(Joomla! Extensions Directory), OSM has decided that after July 1ST only GPL licensed extensions will be listed in the directory. For total details about the decision please see the original announcement {insert link}. 

This decision has generated an enormous amount of discussion in regards to the GPL, open source, and free software philosophies in general. I vehemently disagree with one aspect of the new policy and thought it prudent to compose a proper rant to express myself. My therapist says that this will help me mentally and despite the fact that he is imaginary I've still decided to follow his advice. What follows is a rant suffering from a minor identity disorder. 

# VS Creator 

I find the biggest problem with Open Source advocacy and free software advocacy is that no one ever clearly expresses what they're open sourcing. No one has any real articulation of what a Open Source "thing" is in the first place. When a debate breaks out it inevitably falls along the same old lines of free vs unfree, or open vs closed, and never along the lines of clearly drawn philosophies. I whole heartedly believe that if someone expresses the open source philosophy correctly and the recipient understands that expression then both will come out in agreement. So what is Open Source in the first place? What are we saying should be free and Open?
                

# Creation VS PlatForm | The How's and why nots of paintbrush trademarking | Or What in world is being Open Sourced in the first place? | Or PaintBrush VS Painting  

Not so long in human history there was no internet, no printer + Fax 5in1 combos, no printing press, no rabbits in Australia, and Black Swans were all but completely unexpected. This was a difficult time for writer or written information producers of any kind, for the written word to be re-produced it took days, weeks, or even months and it all had to be done by hand. 

Over time things improved until one day the internet and computers were invented. The internet was a new and powerful production tool for the dissemination of created information. As well as limiting the wide spread effects of carpal tunnel syndrome, the internet also brought with it the ability for the average person to bring his (often unwanted) views to others. 

For awhile the average user competed in complete equality and tranquility with those not so average. Together they created and produced equally well with equal tools, in a sort of continually and infinitely expanding plane of equality. However, all would not remain wonderful in the land of the inter-webs, for the inter-web had not escaped the prying eyes of strange men. Men with funny hats, big round bellies, and expensive suits. These strange men believed the internet needed a change -- a change of tools, a proper equalization they called it. 

So together the strange men gathered and plotted the equalization of tools. Why should all tools be free, when all tools are not equal? As most strange men do; they reasoned, deliberated, calculated risks, forecasted and projected, finally deciding upon a simple solution. Tools of creation should cost, sure their would be free versions but those would be limited in features or expire after a time, so that a user might be inclined to purchase bigger and better features.

For awhile the strange men would hold the inter-webs in their unrelenting and python like grips. On occasion they would make concessions to appease a increasingly agitated mass of users. In time this agitation brought with it heroic men of renown, men with messy hair, wrinkled shirts, and obsessive compulsive disorders. These men armed only a keyboard would defeat the strange men with only a single idea that of free and open software. By creating superior and free creative tools these heroic men we're able to dismantle the entire system that kept the strange men in power.

Okay I admit it, that was way too much verbiage for a simple point. The point is this Open Source is about making the platform or tools of creation free. Many people get the false impression that Open Source is some movement of  Anarchy out to destroy copyrights and the rights of creators everywhere. Open Source is far from that it's about making platforms for creators free and equally accessible to everyone. Open Source Software has never and never will be about the creations, it's always been about the creator and their tools. Open Source Content/Creation advocates are a different matter and something I will discuss later.    

The distinction between tool and creation is one that people both in and out of the Open Source Software movement have enormous trouble keeping straight. A good but not necessarily great analogy is that of the PaintBursh and Painting. 

Imagine the following situation: Say you go to a store and purchase a paintbrush, now before you can checkout imagine that your offered a choice of licenses. License 1, Developer License: This license allows you the ability to create a unlimited number of personal paintings but with the restriction that you cant sell them. License 2, Personal License: You can create a unlimited number of paintings but you can only sell them yourself and not through any stores or affiliates. License 3, 5 Domain License: You can create a unlimited number of paintings and sell them at up to five locations at any time. License 4, Business License: Unlimited Creation and Unlimited selling!! 

Such a prospect sounds absurd but it is truly what happened with software.  Open Source Software set out to create a open platform so that such absurdities did not exist.

Now there is a real big difference between a paintbrush and the painting created with it. Open Source never wanted the painting to be free or advocated that it should be. What they wanted was a easily accessible and quality paintbrush so that everyone with desire could become a painter, not just the big guy. 

Today there is great deal of confusion about platform VS creation. This confusion is the main reason why so many get angry about extensions being considered derivatives of the CMS, or why there are so many users asking if Templates/Themes will be forced to be GPl-compliant or GPL licensed. Personally I take no stance as to rather or not a extension is  a derivative. The simple fact is that most if not all extensions act as a platform for the creation of websites. To license them in a un-open way would be to go against what Open Source Software is about, rather they're derivatives simply does not matter. 

A template is not a tool for creation, it is primarily a creation itself, it is not and never will be a platform, if it becomes a platform it ceases to be just a template. For now CMS's have remained in agreement with that point, however the perspectives are beginning to change. Automatic, the company that manages Wordpress has recently decided to start removing themes from their theme directories that include links to the authors site. I fear the same might happen to other CMS's and web apps, if it does I will voice my objections as loud as possible. Making a template Open Source is like making a song available for free, it works in some instances but in others not so well. Forcing a template to be Open Source is like forcing a artist to give his album away.

# BSD is as BSD does | Or Perspectives on licensing      

The GPL has it's faults, mainly due to it being created for software, with web apps you can have unforseen freedom restrictions created by the GPL. Web apps can by design end up being inexorably hooked with a creation. Imagine that a user builds a fantastic website, realizing the innovation of his tinkering Bob  decides to sell his site. Under the GPL those config files are GPled, they're no if ands or buts they are GPL period. Sure Bob can package his creations separately, but when bundled together seems technically illegal.  I see this practice all the time from template clubs, every Jooomla! template club out produces what they call "launchers" for their templates, which in my humble opinion are violations of the GPL.
                                                                      
The GPL requires credits in the source file, which isn't very useful to a web app developer. As a web app developer I'd definitely prefer to have a link to my site from the forker's site, rather than a link buried in some source file in some folder that hardly anyone will look at. For web apps the MIT or Modified BSD is much preferred.

# Service VS Product

The most common objection to Open Source runs along the lines of "How will I make money selling something that someone else could then give away for free?". This is simply a matter of mis-communication, your simply not selling any product what your selling is the support and instruction for a free product. This is a major issue with Open Source vocabulary, we're constantly presenting Open Source as a different Business Model. In reality it's not a different Business Model, it's a different type of Business all together.  

This is a central reason propiaratary developers get so upset when you tell them to Open Source, it's like telling a vacumm salesmen to sell his vacummcleanear for donations. The way the developer sees it, your asking him to give something away in exchange for reciprocity. When in actuality your asking him to change from a product based business to a service based one, one where instead of selling the paintbrush he's providing painting instruction.
                                   

# On The JED and Rabbits
 
The JED has made allot of Rabbit decisions, but only one really violates the spirit of freedom that is the decision to exclude GPL-compatible licensed extensions from the club. This is big issue for me and one which will if proceeded with, spur me to launch a competing site. The spirit of the GPL allows for GPL-compatible licenses, if I or another developer wants a compatible license then we should be allowed the option. Pure and simple this is a violation of the GPL philosophies. The are numerous reasons to prefer some GPL-compatible licenses over the GPL, but my main reason is how I'm credited. I don't want nor need a mention in the source, it does not benefit me enough. However, what can benefit me as a developer is a link to my site.

Sorry No Rabbits..
