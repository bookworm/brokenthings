In Northern Idaho the coldest time of the year is February. Its the shortest & hardest month of the year; everything done in the previous months is just made harder by the cold.

I've always loved winter for as long as I can remember. Winter brings me time to reflect, clarity, simplicity and direction. Where as summer is full of endless possibilities, winter is full of direction. Most people tend to find the monotony of winter boring, the endless repetition of snow removal seems to destroy their souls. The only thing more bitter than the cold in February is the people. 

I find winter beautiful. While monotony kills others I thrive on it, it gives me time to think, it slows the pace of life down enough to reflect and plan.

During that same week, it rained at the lower elevations. This all during a week that in years past has dropped to the negative teens.

He was like a father to me, we had lived in the same house for 70% of my life. Two weeks after the passing of my Grandfather my childhood mentor and chess coach unexpectedly passed away. My normal time of reflection was suddenly turned into chaos, a time of monotony and predictability into a time of excitement and chaotic events.    

All this year I've found myself grasping, straining, striving, hoping, reaching for winter, but winter never came, simplicity & clarity never came. Idropped of the radar late last year. I've slowly learned through the chaos that the skills necessary to create winters. To not wait for reflective moments, but to create them on demand. To structure the way I live me life so that reflective moments come often.   


It was only when everything completely shattered that I've found the ability to take reflection from days that don't hand them to me. I've

In really snowy winters its the month we clear snow from our roofs. its The chores are harder and he weather is more unforgiving.
