Hi Ken Grimes here, 

First off most zombie stuff heads down the wrong direction giving you survival tips, how to plans etc. The reality is that your going to be completely out of your element in the advent of a zombie apocalypse and implementing things you've read is going to way fucking hard. So your plans should revolve around how do I set myself so that I can both survive and slowly learn the increasing number of survival skills necessary to stay alive.   

For this discussion lets assume a George romero esque zombie. Slow releatively dumb, atrracted by the smell of meat and load noises. We're also going to assume that only their brains have been substantially altered, which means they still require oxygen and can be killed by severe blood loss. This prevents any underwater travel. It also limits the number of zombies to those recently deceased and those alive. No reanimation from beyond the grave bullshit.  


1. Firearams 

A quick note on silencers, silcencers unlike what you see in the movies don't really do much. Fire a gun in the city is probably just effing stupid under any cirucmstance. Don't do it. 

First of all most pople don't realize is that ammo is going to run out so you need to make sure you get some good bow and arrows.            

2. Locations.     


I think as far as survival goes only one movie got it right. It depends on your local but find a boat and get the fuck on it. Then you want to find a place to keep that. The ultimate survival spot is going to be somewhere close to shore in a large bay with little to no surrounding population. Why not just head into the woods in a low populted area? Well game hunting is actually pretty fucking hard if you don't know what your doing. You risk running out of food supply before you learn how to hunt well enough to feed yourself. Fish by far is the easiest thing to catch. So what does this give us? Coast of Canada and Alaska, parts of Oregon coast & Washington.


3. Long term.

Considering the virulence of a zombie virus of we have to consider the possiblity that this will remain a long term issue for the remanents of mankind.


# On Cities             

Golden rule never ever be stuck, its trade off safety for movement. Never ever do you want to be surounded by a horde of zombies and be in say a fucking mall. The good plan of hold up is total utter fucking suicide, because eventually you will die. By holding up your only biding time. You always want to be able to move at any time. Freedom of movement will always be your number one survival skill. You want to stay away from where the zombies are.

## If your stuck in a city when it hits. 

If your thinking about rushing out don't, your liable to get caught in the chaos. Where you want to head is place where you've good proximity to leave, be nice to have a good means transportation an ATV is preferable, and a food supply for two weeks worth.   

Typically in a city your going to have have plans, everyone is supposed going to schools and shit, the huge majority will go. Your not going to go. Your going to go to those peoples houses. Find a good empty house preferably one with for sale sign, rip that sign out (no idiot a for sale sign doesn't signal zombies, it does however signal the living) and then go inside. You wait for a week or so until the shit has died down and the streets are free then you get on the fucking highway and head to the nearest river system. 

## Stuck on a city. 

Lets say your on an island, I hate to say it but this is going to be a hell of a ride. If you're in a city make sure to plan ahead and have some supplys. Raiding them is unlikely to be an option, in a city the streets will be fucking dangerous. The only benfit the city holds is something beneath it. I've thought long and hard about being stuck in a city when zombies hit. I used to have plans ranging from holding out until the city chaos died down in a skyscraper then base jumping. Going through the stairs in skyscapers is fucking suicide your liable to get trapped by everything from a fire to actual zombies. Best to wait it out in the hgiher floors.

Your going to want to take your food supply and hop into a sewage system. You can figure out where you should go by research homeless undergorund in your city. Allot of places in tunnels are ridden with disease the best way to avoid dying down there is to find the correct spot. 

Your going to keep any eye on things from below until the coast is clear. The reality though is you'll probably not make it.

If you make it until the coast is clear your going to have to get transportation. Don't look for it in the city, bad fcucking idea. You'll probably die before you find something you can steal and use. If you get lucky then by all means take the transportation and go. But if not then head for the nearest metro. No your not taking the metro, but you're going to take the tracks. I guarantee you the safest road out will be the train tracks. 

Once you've hoofed it out of the main city you need to take stock of the situation and evaluate where to find transportation. Once you've got it head for the river.


Once your on the boat your long term survival prospects are pretty good but your going to need some company. So be sure to leave impressive comments on Quora to impress fellow Zombie apocalyspe enthuisasists. Maybe you'll get yourself a lady or man friend to spend out your remaining years with.
