title: Open Source Can Set You Free.
body: |             

We all have them, our pet projects; the psds of unfinished mockups, the code of abandoned sites, the templates that never were, the poetry we've never
submitted, the novel about a young yo-yo prodigy who journeys into the Himalayan mountains to train with a slightly gay monk. Okay, not that last one but you
get my point.

These projects tie us down, they weigh on our minds, the sit on our heads like a fat bully, they pull us back to them like a nagging monster in the closet.
What assholes these projects be. Have they no respect for our mental health?

I value open source, I value the community; a community thats not just freedom lovers, pony tail sporters & funny hat wearing people all giving to each other
freely. Its a community of all ages, of all hairstyles & hat styles brought together by the idea that knowledge should be shared.

We develop open source projects not because we can profit, but because we enjoy giving to others. But can open source be more than giving? Can it help me as
much as it helps others? I think it can and its why I've decided to start giving *everything* I do away. If its not worth giving then its not worth saving.
Because maybe just maybe open source can set me free.
