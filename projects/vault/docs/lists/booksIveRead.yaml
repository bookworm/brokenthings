Title: Tech Books I've Read

  - title: HTML5 For Webdesigners
    note: | 
      Yet another book by the God of clarity, Jeremy Keith. Its a bit sparse on depth; but like all of Jeremy's books its written so well that you'll get allot
      from the tiny 85 pages. If you can then pickup DOM scripting and Bulletproof Ajax as well. Both of his other books are impeccably well written, although
      getting a little outdated now.

  - title: Microformats Made Simple.
    note: |
      You might be asking, how did they squeeze out entire book about microformats? Your question reflects my question. Microformats simply aren't well suited too 
      book form. By its very natue it takes a sentence to explain and a constantly updated wiki to document. Some things shouldn't be put in book form. Don't read 
      this just google microformats instead.      
      
      ## On microformats.
      As a tech microformats is a relic from a time when valid HTMl was held up like a God. When we started to adopt moving specs like HTMl5 in everyday apps we 
      through validation out the window. Validation is dead and thus so are microformats. Its become acceptable to create and use cusotm attributes in your html 
      elements, use them.
