    note: |  
      I've always been interested in anomalous science and Charles fort is basically the father of it all. 
      He came before Graham Hancock an the modern era of anomalous science researchers. 
      Anomalous science tangles with fringe science and pseudoscience, so its important to not take such works at face value.
      Anomalous facts by their very nature are usually just incomplete understandings and not the result of the unexplainable.
