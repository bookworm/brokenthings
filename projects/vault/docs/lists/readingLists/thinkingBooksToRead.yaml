    note: |
      Growing up a "prodigy" I was constantly fighting against a world that couldn't accomodate me.
      I'm bitter about very little in life, adolescence is one thing I will probably never forgive western culture for doing to me.
      Western culture robbed me of so much potential simply because I was considered too young.  
      
      Teenage rebellion is a natural reaction to being controlled. Adolescence is a system of slavery and oppression that remains socially acceptable to this day.
      The legal system enforces it and the culture encourages it.       
      
      I put all my genius into board games and hobby pursuits because academic pursuits weren't available. 
      People don't realize how demotivating it is to put limits on a highly motivated invidual's pursuits. 
      I was constantly barraged by people who felt I was somehow squandering my intellect on useless hobbies, that I should have been using it towards academics.
      The reality of the academic system in America is that graduating HS before 16 is near impossible without wealth & power backing you.    
      When your ready for college at 11 the idea of spending years of proving one self intelligent enough does not motivate, it demotiviates. 
      
      The American education complex doesn't just fail to accommodate genius its, at times, hostile to it.  
      
      To this day people give me strange looks for being a college dropout as if somehow I've wasted my life. 
      I stopped caring about the system a decade ago, when it failed me. How many more will it fail before America wakes up and stops babying young adults?
