      Matt Taibi is the most insightful and humorous political commentator alive today. 
      This book totally nails the state of American politics and the common psychological/sociological origins of both left & right. 
      The ultimately depressing reality of American politics is that system is hopelessy broken; his humor ultimately helps soften the blow of this reality. 
      If your left or right Matt Taibis writing is going to be hard to face, but if you can take a step back and let your delusions go you'll come out a better person.
      
      One thing I've learned from my own experience of leaaving the far right and fundmentalist religion is that you can't take the pill all at once.
      It may seem you left your previous views in one fell swoop but really what it was, was a tipping point. 
      Keep feeling your mind with different ideas and opinions they become seeds ready to sprout when the time is right.
      I read this a few years before I ever woke up and took value from what it said.
