      This a great gem of environemtal reading, an unlikely book for understanding environment destruction. 
      If you want to help change coastal environmental policies you need understand the history of beaches. 
      This book is by far the easiest to digest (light on jargon) and most cohesive picture of American beach history.

      Like any magazine article collection, the type of writing varies as well as the quality. Some bits are very very interesting others not so much.
      Don't read this from cover to cover, its a great geek boredom book that you can pikcup and flick to an interesting article. 
      Its a gold mine if your willing too jump around and explore.
  - title The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy   
    completed:true
    note: |
      One of the best most well written historical economics books I've ever read. This is a must read for anyone intrerested in how products/processes are adopted in-mass.
      The shipping container is one of few big changes of the modern age to have completed its run. 
      Its adoption, form, technology and methods haven't changed much since the 80s. 
      All these attributes combine to make the shipping container a perfect study case for understanding how things go from idea to mass adoption.
      This inspired more thoughts on economics, manufacturing, culture, & design than any other book I've read.
