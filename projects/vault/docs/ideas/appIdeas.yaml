ideas:
  - title: IE Shooting Game   
    note: |
       What the title says, a game where you shoot IE. Coded this up in flash awhile back but lost the code. 
       Its a quick code if I ever get a free day. Probably would go viral in the dev/design community.      
   - title: Build a browser for developers  
     note: |
       Potentially vim inspired as well.

    - title: MAC Download manager that auto-extracts and imports media.

        I'm not really sure why no one has done this yet. 
        There is one specifically for mp3 + iTunes, but one with flexible media handlig isn't really available.
        Shouldn't be that hard to do.
