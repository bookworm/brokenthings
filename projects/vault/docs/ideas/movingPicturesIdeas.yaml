      A long while back Feynman did this awesome PBS series called "Fun To Imagine". Checkout the series you'll love it.     
      In the series he talked about scientific concepts in a visual manner which wa simply phenonmal. 
      Feynman's knack for explaining scientific concepts really shun through. 
      The nature of his analogies lend themselves to being animated.
