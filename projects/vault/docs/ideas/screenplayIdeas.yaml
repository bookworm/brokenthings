  - title: Bob. Its hard being an Alien.
    note: |
      Bob, is a grunt in a massive industrial operation researching the local lifeforms in a small solar system, at the edge of the milkyway.
      Its an environment where everyone from your supervisors to your supervisor supervisor hates their job. 
      All workers have been assigned to one of the worst shit holes this side of Beetlejuice, Earth. 
      
      Bobs job puts him in charge of the adduction & transportation of native population, an ATN for hshort.
      Bobs work is mind numbingly mudane until one day somehow, a mistake is made, and a local lifeform awakes during transportation.
      Bob and his best friend Garry, anxious for adventure, set out to recover the lost Earthling in hopes of achieving re-assignment to one of the cooler planets.
      Hilarity soon follows.
  - title: The First People.  
    note: |
      Its the year 15,000 BC, the height of the Atlantean civilization. A modern steam-punk esque cviclizaition spans the globe.
      This civilization is about to meet its end. 
      
      Its a typical apocalyptic film the twist being the steam-punk setting. Done correctly this could work well, done wrong its another Wild Wild West failure.
