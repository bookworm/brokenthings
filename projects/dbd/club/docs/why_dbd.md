# The gist of it. 

I've already said some things that brought you here now 'll try and say some things that make you stay, but not specifically here. I'd rather like you on the signup page. With DBD I try to transcend the normal arena of flashy and bloated templates full of stuff that keep you away from code. 

Other products are full of barriers that keep you from digging in and experimenting, from getting your hands dirty and well, breaking stuff. When you do have to touch code its often a dreadful and frustrating experience. The fact is most clubs don't design their products to be dug into and as a result their code is convoluted and very rarely prepared for people who enjoy learning and breaking things.

DBD templates are designed from the ground up to be broken and modified, to kicked around and blown up. That means; no core bloat, no code lock (to grid specific grid system or extension), and no complicated parameter systems. 

Are template 

Template clubs often operate in a interest protecting fashion pushing away collaborators or potential users. Controlling things allows a club to control the directions they and their community take. I recognize that whats in my best self interest is to allow freedom to allow a organic changing of business. As such I recognize that that I will need to quickly adapt and change to meet the ever evolving demands of the DBD community. I don't know where DBD is going to go but I'm prepared to go there. In the strictest sense I think DBD more than other template club is club for and by its own users.

  If you ask me "What is Design BreakDown?", your not going to get very useufl. 
  If you want to know what DBD is about, your better off asking the question "What is Design BreakDown now?".

  One thing I've learned is that future is unpredictable and surprisingly chaotic. 
  The harder you try to predict the future and to control your destiny, the more likely you are to fail. 
  I've learned to live with chaos, to expect the black swan and be ready &amp; welcoming when it rears its black head.

Template clubs 


I do my best to foster a uniquely free &amp; open community by; 
 
1. Keeping plans simple. 

Individual and multiple user accounts, that its. Both account types come with full privileges and unlimited rights, unlimited domains, psds etc. The only difference between the two subscription plans is the number of people allowed access to DBD. 

This helps foster the community and grow. Are you a company with many developers? Then buy a pack of accounts for all your developers. It makes my products easier for you to use and for me to interact with you. Wf course keeping with the DBD philosophy this is not enforced just encouraged. If you'd like to learn more about the benefits of "we plan" over the "me plan" read the FAq item here.

This is a strikingly different model than other clubs who often have convoluted and complex pricing schemes. I keep the DBD plans as dirt simple as possible.  

2. Making all our templates publicly available in the form of their jumpstart packages.
Some template clubs will release a template alone and then have jumpstarts available to more privileged members. This is counter productive to what a "teaser" is trying to achieve. A teaser should make you want more and as such should not be crippled crappy version of the real product. I make the jumpstarts available so you get the fullest demo psosible. 

3. Link to competitors.

As far as I know at the time of this writing, we are the only template club to link to the sites of competitors. Why in the world would I do this? Because I benefit from their growth and they benefit from mine. Together we grow the communities of those who use the same cms platforms to build their sites.

4. Collaborate with competitors.           

I do my best to collaborate and work with fellow developers. From releasing collaborative projects at other template clubs to participating in the user communities of other clubs.  

Full of tools.

From a template framework to the upcoming forge system DBD provides a variety of simple and adaptable tools to help you build sites quicker and easier.    

Current.

1. Simplex. The template framework combines the complex and simple.
 
%p
  Not only does this template framework possess an awesomely creative pun for its name but it also boasts the smallest and largest feature set of any template framework.      

%p
  What? Smallest and largest you say? Yes. 
  You see Simplex is designed to be used by other template developers in variety of situations, development standards and designs. 
  There is no lock into grid systems, module loading, parameter system or specific file and folder structure. 
  Twist, bend, break and morph Simplex into what you need it to be and only what you need it to be.    
    
%p
  Simplex can be distributed as plugin and can have specific modifications packaged ivniduallhy within a template, or the whole framework can be packaged with the template. 
  Simplex, it's versatile.      
  
%p
  Need a layout handling system? Just load the layout system. Just need a child theme system? Include that. 
  Need css and js compression? Include that. Need to use mootools? No problem. Need to use jquery? 
  No problem. Need to add classes for specific browser css? Just load the browser class. 
  Need to automatically solve JS conflicts? No Problem, just include the media library.

%p
  A full dedicated Simplex site is coming soon. Watch our <a href="http://twitter.com/designbreakdown">twitter page</a> for updates.   

Under Development.

1. Events System on the DBD Site.      
2. Forge Jumpstart.
  For a long time users have dealt with incompatible extensions and broken integration with templates. A solution is coming very soon. Luanch date Nov 1.
3. Frontend editing system for Simplex. 
Previously found in the template framework thememagic at Joomlaxtc. The frontend widgets are returning and they'll be more customizable than ever before. Powered by the awesome Simplex parameter system allowing a full variety of storage and dipslaying options. Paramters can be saved and loaded using everything from a yaml backend to mongodb.

DBD Will change you.


DBD, lets break stuff together.  

This page itself needs to adapt to the needs to change its language to communicate its message effectively. Have I done a good enough job? Are you convinced? Or do you feel that my communication lacks? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
