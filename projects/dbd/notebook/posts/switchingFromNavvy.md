title: "Switching From Navvy."   
type: 'note'
tags: [ 'ruby', 'padrino', 'jobque', 'sinatra' ]
status: 'public'
intro: |  

When I started on the DBD sites I found navvy to be the best option for building a job que on mongammpeper + sinatra. Since that time time deleyaed_job has
progressed along and now possesses a robust mongomapper backend. After some recent navvy issues I've decided to switch to delayed_jobs. Navvy's performance is
simply to fickle and I want something a little more stable before DBD goes live.
