It wasn't that visualidiot was particularly interesting or even that he was a particularly good designer but he was sorta funny; so we, for a time, followed him. 

We let him lead us into the strangest of places. He taught us how to say [Hello](http://visualidiot.com/articles/hiya) to the world. We campaigned & bailed him out when he was jailed for [hacking facebook](http://visualidiot.com/articles/hacking-facebook). One day he taught us [how to look good in our avatars](http://visualidiot.com/articles/avatars) & win friends. He left funny condescending comments on our dribbbles & inspired us to call him insulting names like asshole & idiot.

He introduced  the [photo editor](http://visualidiot.com/articles/photoshop) we loved to hate to an entirely new web audience. With a simulation that would prepare entire new generations of designers with the skills they would need to design.    

When we started to forget who we were and our purpose, he reminded us of those we had [lost](http://visualidiot.com/articles/ie) and how far we had come. 

So I was deeply saddened by his admission of his addiction to Meth and thus his inability to bring new articles. I hope he overcomes his addictions and finds his way to his text editor again, so that he may create great things for us once again. I will pray to Chuck the chipmunk for his swift recovery. 

Chuck has communicated to me through a series of squeaks that he is there for visualidiot always, also he'd like you to sacrifice chocolate colored hazeltnuts to him.

So is he really addicted to Meth?

He is addicted to Breaking Bad so basically the same symptoms and resulting behaviors. He stays up all night doing shit he shouldn't be doing. He'll lose his job & eventually all his monies
