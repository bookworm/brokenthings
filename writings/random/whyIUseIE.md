I consider myself an explorer in the same vein as Magellan or Columbus. Internet explorer brings back the
wild west feeling of the web. I miss the days of animated construction guys, flashing gifs and scrolling
pink seizure inducing text. The inconsistencies in IE rendering help provide me with a similar experience
today.

I use IE and I feel like I'm an explorer seeing and experiencing things no one else gets to see, at least
not like I see it. Everyone else views the web from the comfort of their motor-homes, but I'm an explorer
with just a backpack & tent. 

Sometimes I use IE6 so I can feel like Bear Grylls fighting for survival in the harsh elements. IE6 is
like traveling without any gear, its just me and the elements. Completely exposed, I must rely solely on
myself to combat and survive the perils of the web. I plug security holes with my fingers, fight wild
viruses by vigilantly watching for signs of trouble, and I close popups like an Australian snake
wrestler; I grab a popup by its close icon and kill it.

So why do I use IE? To feel alive!
