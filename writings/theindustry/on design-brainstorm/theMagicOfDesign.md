We sit on the edge of our seats waiting for dribble likes. 

We forget what we are & how special we are. We can

We think we go unnoticed but we don't. Is a real connection across vst open expanse of the interwebs to another mind. Suddenly he can appreciate what you see & you can see what he sees.         

Thats what the design community its this magical place. Thats what makes design so special its the art & science of restructuring another's mind.

Entrepeneurhsip is the drive to find others like you, those with the same needs. Design is about creating others like you. I think thats why such great people are attracted to our community. We've this innate desire to share what we see with others.


If we can shift their perspective just a little. Its not about the designs its about the people.

Sometimes it takes a long time for people to take notice, design is more than the visual its an abudnacne of things coming to tgether. Design is the package & allot can go into it.

In 

Walt Disney saw . Others saw a delusional man stuck in childhood. He'd make them see it.        

Apple products . Automobiles. Planes. Buttons. Fukcing buttons man. All these things have change the way people see & interact with tehir world. 

We see are design as meaningless as simple contributions to heepless void of pretty icons. As web designers we tend to get a bit full of ourselves. We rave against projects like graislist & their poor design. But are they really poorly designed? Craiglists does what it was intended to do quite well. It was designed well. 

The things that we associate with great design might not be things that are great. Design is a complex symphony of of everything.  
The most magical industry on earth.

Keep shifting your perspective. Keep looking for origami.
