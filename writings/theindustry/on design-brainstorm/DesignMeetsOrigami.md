Something magical happened on the way to a paper crane.
                                                          
For most of mathematical history the tools of mathematician have been a ruler, a compass, numbers & his head.
You see in mathematics one has to continually deal with the concept of "constructible numbers". Constructible numbers are the godfather of math, with a simple compass and straitedge so much can be diserned about world. But like any icon constructible numbers have an idiot brother that lurks in the shadows waiting to show up and ruin apportant events.

For a long time origami was seen to be; at worst a way to impress a girl with pretty little swans and at best an art form. It wasn't until the 1980's that mathematicians started to take notice.    

Mathematicians would run through the streets naked & covered only by. Professors would annoy their small children during arts & crafts time with lectures on the properties techaderhedrons. The paper companies expereinced and unheard of boom. And suddenly Japanese men face continual harrasment by overzealous white hipsters seek 

Of course much of this is hyperbole, but what it is true is that for the first time in a long time mathematicians had a fundamentally new way to look at their world, the world of numbers. Suddenly mathematicians could see new shapes. Whole new worlds were available. Suddenly they were alive. A whole new wave of ideas came forth from this shift of perspective. They could take numbers & with the right combination of dexterity and paper make them real anytime anyplace. It was magical.

What does origami have to do with design?  

As designers we stand at the place science and art meet. Artists try to see the world differently scientists try to see the world as it is. Designers try to    

I often think about giving design up all together & focusing on development but then I remember what design gives me. Through the eyes of a designer I see whole new worlds. 


I'm going to leave you with a little call to arms. Don't focus or even getting better. Focus on seeing new things. on growing your appreciation for the things designers see. The shiny things can distract us and we often forget why we are designers in the first place. Keep looking for origamis.


1. I should briefly mention that paper swans have been replaced by paper Tardis's as the impressive structure of choice.
