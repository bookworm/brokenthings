One cannot truly appreciate design by seeing it nor even in using it. One can only truly appreciate design in the results. Great design spreads, it invokes passion for it. It makes life better, not just for a little while, but long after the design is gone its influence remains. In the way we used, the things we built with it, the things we did for other it. No more so can see this in Apple, a simple design grew, like a mother it made designs. This is perhaps the greatest gift of Steve Jobs, not his vision, not his ideas or even his character, it was the products. 

Where other businessmen where blind, he could see. He could see the things we could see. The invisible. The design.  

The products he gave us through their simple worth
But this is not a celebration of Apple, it is a celebration of design.

We are spectators in the. Keepers of greatest secret to modern times.  

I to can see what no one else sees.

I can see all the complexity behind the simplicity.

I can see the precision behind the kerning in the most rarest of fonts. I can see 

I hear the thousand cuss words The hours spent tweaking. That moment when I post to dribble and I wait for the feedback.  The hours spent growing.  

I see the logos, 

Its simple in its presen     

We are the artists of the invisible. Are end goal is to remain unseen.

We architect through implication & then hope we made sense.

I strive to create products that are designed.

And when I see it used, to see my work on the screen, oh I feel the pride, I feel the joy, then I smile; if they only knew
what I knew. If only they could they could see what I see.  

So why design? To spread forth the appreciation I feel, so that others may see what I see. Can you see what I see?
