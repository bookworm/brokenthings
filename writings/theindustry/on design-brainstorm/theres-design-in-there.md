Its increasing common 

Good design is the great communicator, it brings us all the same place & gives us the same tools to communicate. 
Github was there long before github was. We had version control, we had project management, we had bug trackers but it was until github came along that we started using that technology.

Some developers view these abstractions as a bad practice, I see it as simply good design. Allowing us to forget or internalize the same things.

Good design brings people to the same place & then encourages them to create. Projects like github & heroku, may not be visually the most amazing out there but design wise they're one of the best. They've spawned a hundred little clones & slowly change the culuture.


The biggest, the forefather of this all if you may was 37signals. The created rails, now rails wasn't the best, most feature rich or even all that unique. What it had going for it was design, design that was leaps in bounds above the competition. ORM's were complicated behemoths, activerecord was simple. 


Its because as ruby devs we appreciate good design, we know its values, we've personally benefited. 

The influence is growing as the shift to. Daniel once wrote oration as the great equalozer. Design is becoming central to us. As our tools become ever more complex its more important than ever that we think about their design.
