A big myth persistent through our cultures is this idea that there are special people. These "special people" are somehow endowed, blessed by some almighty being, or luck of nature, with certain genetic factors that make them amazing. We are all to happy to cultivate the idea of genius, innate talent and overnight successes because they make great stories. People like stories more than facts.

The reality is that when you begin to look at genius and you pull back the mythologies, you discover something extraordinary, that these "special people" aren't extraordinary at all. They're just like you or me. They haven't been blessed, they haven't won the genetic lottery or even been granted some secret knowledge from Ancient Aliens, they're normal. 

I wont re-iterate the studies on this but I will simply point you in the right direction. My favorite examples are;

1. The Polgar Sisters: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r 
2. Boris Sidis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James_Sidis#Parents_and_upbringing_.281898.E2.80.931909.29
3. The Beatles http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eHa9n4jbGw

I find the idea of talent a fundamentally toxic idea. It creates an environment where children start to think "oh I'm just not good at Math" or "Science is for male brains" and society as a whole is far too happy to reinforce the labels. It's very sad to me that people give up on things or never even try simply because society has told them they wouldn't succeed. Labels are fundamentally a way society victimizes people until they fall in line with culture. 

If successful people can be said to have anything "special" about them it's simply their unwillingness to accept the status quo. They're as Steve's Jobs famously put it "The Crazy Ones". 

Want to be successful? Don't believe what others tell you about you, be a bit Crazy and never ever let them label you "talented".

P.S The best book on an anti-talent approach to learning that I've have read is The Art Of Learning by Josh Waitzkin. Read it http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Learning-Journey-Performance/dp/0743277465. It's sort of like Timothy Ferriss' writings on learning but for people that want to actually learn.
