What is going on with this guy's hair? Why does he have a little bit sticking up at the back? Aren't user icons supposed to be without character?

Why did you have to go and add personality to a bland user icon? Now I cant help but think about this guy. His hopes, his dreams, his desires, his likes, his choice in underwear. Okay, that got creepy and the end there but he wants to be viewed sexually. Look at him with his hair out to the side, he wants it.

Does he wear his hair like that because he is trying to be hip? Maybe he hopes to one day become a punk rock singer? Is this Gallic at the back of his head? Pehraps, he has spent his whole life dealing with the fact that people assume it's an hairstyle. They've put labels on him and pushed him into a mold. He didn't want to be this way it's just easier to conform to people expectations of him.

Maybe because his hair looks like he just took off a baseball cap people thought he liked baseball; so he joined the team to please them. Maybe he discovered he was actually quite good, but with success came more expectations.

Now he is thirty and he finds himself playing a game he never really liked surrounded by people who only like him for something he is not. Maybe he has a wife who only found him attractive because of his hairstyle. Maybe the stress of success keeps piling up so he starts using drugs; but ironically taking drugs is stressful.

Before he knows it he is spending all his time hiding his drug addiction, no time to practice, no time for his wife and two kids. So maybe he starts to feel lonely and sad. Maybe he feels like his life was never his. Like he spent all his years living for others and never living for himself.

Maybe one day he just cant take it anymore so he quits. Just fucking quits everything. Quits his job, quits his wife, quits his kids; quits his life. Maybe he moves to Brazil and marries a Brazilian super-model. Maybe he opens a small surfing shop and settles down to a nice calm life. Until one day his team needs him to win a game against an evil baseball team from Finland. His childhood coach Gordon Bombay has assembled a ragtag crew of his former teammates to save the pride of the USA.

Or maybe not.

The point is you've ruined my life Morgan. You're like a bald little satan with glasses; designing things for the sole purpose of causing your fellow humans to develop a bond with your designs. Yet sometimes you change them, kill them, or maybe just never let them go live. Just like with that rocket thing that animated into that awesome logo thing; where is my god damn hypercompact?

I bet you plan to kill this guy. It wont even be in a product again. He'll just fade away. I'm attached damnit. Don't take this guy away from me.

Sorry, it's Friday today and being at a desk all day is apparently affecting my brain patterns. Thank Joe Pesci for the weekend.

Also what is that arrow? Why is it pointing at things?...
