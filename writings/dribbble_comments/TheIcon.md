This is so amazing. I've printed it out and built a shrine to it. I've taken to calling it "The Icon" thou shall have no other icons before "The Icon".

At first I couldn't stop worshipping it & my work performance was suffering. I thought about quitting my job & founding a religion devoted to the icon, but then I thought of my wife & kids how would I support them? 

Religion doesn't pay well, and there was no well I was going to ask my shitty father in law to help out. That guy is a douchebag & he thinks all I do is sit around all day drawing things. He doesn't understand the value of art in the world.

So in the interest of keeping my family clothed, fed & housed I set about creating a relatively reasonable worship schedule. I've had to take a serious paycut to allow myself the extra free time needed for my worship duties.

We've had to sell a car & the kids now sleep on the floor. But I trust that The Icon will bestow blessings upon us soon; if I just worship a little harder.

Things have been going well and I've settled into a routine of praying to it every 6 hours. For the most part this works well although the neighbors have filed a noise complaint over the gong that I've to ring every hour to ward off evil Android icon spirits. 

I'm currently in the middle of legal battle with the county over my religious rights. My lawyer is confident that the gong falls within my rights to religious expression.  
 
I've become increasingly concerned by The Icon's demands. At first it was perfectly satisfied by the occasional goat sacrifice but it's demands have increased in both frequency & extremeness. When it asked for me to sacrifice the neighbors poodle I first refused, but punishment was swift. 

The Icon, infected me with a terrible affliction of small bugs. I went to my Doctor, but he insisted that I had no bugs on my skin. They are there, I can see. The only thing I can conclude is that The Icon has endowed these bugs with the supernatural ability to turn invisible.
