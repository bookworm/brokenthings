Just a logo. See full view for the logo with it's friends; a text block I call "Bio", a laid-back copyright text called "Copyo" and a contact line called "Schilling".

Bio likes describing entities (he does not discriminate against non-human entities or even non-biological entities), good typography, and strangely, penguins. Bio hopes to one day become a solo text block and branch out to describing things on other sites like twitter, app.net, and maybe even Facebook; although he has concerns about Facebook's increasingly hostile approach to privacy.

Copyo is a hippie type that just wants people to share. He hopes one day that all information will be freely available and freely shared just because it's there. He says that "Text has a life of it's own, it wants to spread, to be shared, to be read. When we share text, we don't just share that text, we share the sum all the ideas of those that shared it before. Great text takes ideas and it extrudes them outwards until they cover the whole world."

Pavel has dreams of becoming more than just a contact line. He wants to see the world. There are so many sites out there, so many places he could fit. He wants to see them all. He wants to feel the rush of a click and the soar of his adrenaline as he knows he has become a medium for connecting two humans across immense distances of space. Space separates us and it's the Pavels of the world that bring us back together.
