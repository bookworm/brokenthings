@Tyler Galpin 

I'd like to address the clearly misleading shot that Tyler so cleverly cut off at 400 pixels to hide the full extent of its ludicrous claims. I bet he did this intentionally so he would have Plausible deniability. Typical Canadians, covering their hind area to prevent possible responsibility. 

This is just like that time in the 1800s when Canadians ransacked the entire Eastern United States and then blamed the weather; when everyone and their mother knows Canada has a giant weather machine they discovered when they first landed (via levitating Polar Bears) in Canada. Think such an idea is silly? 

So did everyone in the 1800's until 1864, December 24th at a quarter till eleven when it all started. 

It would take nearly four days for the Sheriff department of Wollowhutt, NY to dig out the Dugson's..... dead bodies. 
The Dugson's cabin had been buried in what many eye-witnesses reported as being between 8inches and 18ft of snow. 
To add insult to injury young Sherff Deputy John Calzone continued to make Dugson puns throughout the day, which greatly offended and traumatized the Dugson's only remaining son Jeffrey. 

Years later, John Calzone would die at the hands of a raccoon that cleverly managed to deploy bullets from John's shotgun by pressing the shotgun's deployment trigger. This hilarious story would be re-told in folk songs as a lesson to people not to drink and shoot raccoons, a valuable lesson to the people of the time. 
Sadly, such a folk song did not have the same timelessness as other great songs like "Black Betty"; nonetheless "Don't fuck with raccoons while drunk" lives on and to this day can be heard in Appalachian communities if you know where to look.

Interestingly John wasn't drunk, he was just an idiot, but the idea that he was a drunk brought much comfort to his family and friends. The idea that your loved one is an idiot is hard to accept. 

Eye witness accounts reported up to 34ft of snow in the Appalachian mountains, many of these witnesses were well respected members of their community.

James Jeremiah of West Virginia reported 17ft of snow in his town, as well as a large conference of Leprechauns, 
which James speculated: "were likely drawn to the area by the snow, which everyone knows can be transformed to gold by unicorn urine". 
James Jeremiah was the local intellectual leader of his town, it's pastor, soul, and leader.

No one would willing stay in Canada unless there was some sort ancient device capable of creating weather up there. Still doubt me?
Canada is the only place on earth with only two seasons, partially cold and totally cold. 

This all brings to my main point. The United States has never exploited blackholes ever. We have never even been capable of producing blackholes. 

Perhaps it's actually Canada that is exploiting blackholes with their science and their homosexuals and their weather machines.
Canada go back to where you came from! 

Anyone who thinks I'm being too hard on Tyler should know that Tyler has been responsible for as many as three separate incidents
of Comic Sans usage. He thought it would be funny, but I think we can all agree there is nothing funny about Comic Sans.
