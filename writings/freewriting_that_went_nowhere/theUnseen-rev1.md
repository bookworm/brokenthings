Its funny, as creatives we spend most of our days and nights creating, but the end result, the visible output, it's just a tiny part of what we created. This blog is dedicated to showing the unseen process that goes into creative works. It is a notebook of all my failures, ideas, mis-starts and restarts. It is not from success that we learn the most but rather from our failures. Together lets learn from failure and break some stuff.
                                                                                                                                                
Creative work is a rarity in that the most valuable..... Need to somehow contrast with science... Scientific output is respected for the failure in its data. Creative work should be polished and awesome, finsiehd and complete etc.

This is the the toil, the scribble the sleepless hour at midhgnight. It is a journal of the unseen effort. Follow me to the place where failure merge into success and back again  

Its a catalog of failure... it is the art of breaking things. In the beginning there was failure and then there was success. WTF happened in between?  

Like everything else on this site this page is a on going work in progress. Every creative work has a process, of tweaking, of iteration followed by modification and then repeat

When I reflect upon the things I've never created,  a broken endless stream of; starts, mistrys, mistakes. I realize that likelyhood of any one work mkaing it....
Its a goddamn miracle.

That aweomse and amazing work that we as culture rever even exists is a fucking miracle.  It is a freak accident broguth about sheer coincidence, man hours, and sheer tweaking unto the work is beaten into a bloody masterpiece. 

Lets analyze the typical TV show with its perhaps 20-30 hours of footage per episode. Per fucking episode, that is 20-30 hours of footage all to produce 45 minutes of what often turns out to be shit anyway. 

Its in the journey to reation where the real vlaues lies . I don't want to the easy result, I want to how its made to look easy. Are some us decieeved into thinking we are alone? That everything creates and craps out a stream of golden eggs, while we alone must the one who can only shit shit?
