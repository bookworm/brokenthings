# Work around the edges

Do the little things. 

# Execute and Break things down.

Build tasks lists of task you know how to do. Never add a TODO that you cant just execute.
If a TODO cant be executed on put it in a separate list to think about and let it gestate until you know how to break it down.

# Build the pieces. Throwaway code

There is a tendency to wait for wholes, to build it once and the right way. Don't do that. Learn to recognize polish but don't strive for it.You often wont understand how to build something until you played around a bit in the sandbox. 

There is tendency to think that once you start on a project you should know how to do it. That's never the fully going to be the case.
You're going to wast a lot of time thinking about problems. Experiment with things. Building code you will never use helps you build code you will.

Don't fear the junkyard, embrace the sandbox.
