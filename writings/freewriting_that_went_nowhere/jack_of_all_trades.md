Welcome to the communication bog down,   



I used to struggle with playing two board games at once and the 

Most literal jack of all trades aren't literal jack of all trades .     

I'm often 

I hate how Tim Ferris and few others big time multi-taskers propagate the myth of that someone can be good at many things. Granted Tim Ferris is skilled at learning,    


So all of this said how do I handle so many different tasks? Saturation. 

You need to get all the other crap out of your head.

Often for me I use the weekend as transition time and I gear up for the next few days of what I'm going to be doing things.

When I go back its like getting the some neurons firing again.

When your trying to get to many types of thing done at onc eits like your brain comes to slow . That stress its your brain telling you that what your doing isn't working.

I try to phase my projects as much as possible and make sure I have stuff prepared for the transition into other phases.
                                                                                                                               
Like "Putting that menu on the left to keep visual clutter in header down". 

This keeps my brain from getting whirldwinded and getting occupied on stuff later in a projects phase. I know from personal experience that a design decision later in my project can fuck up my whole workflow, something that if my brain had been in it would take a few hours adds a week to my timeline.

I know Adam Savage of mythbusters fame likes to keep an enormous librayr of linsk, photos, etc for each project and then he returns to this stuff in later phases. What they do on mythusters is engineering generalism and although a compeltely different field the earning processes and workflows are similar to operating as a generalist in any field.

At any given your not a dev, designer your are something much more specific. Become what you are doing now. 





I know for a fact that Shaun Inman for instance doesn't tend to juggle development and design work at the same time.
