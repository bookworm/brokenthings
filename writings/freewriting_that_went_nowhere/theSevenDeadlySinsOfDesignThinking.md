## Ready Set Sin.

Why is that creatives can never press the publish button? Some would say its a drive for perfection, I think that assumption
although close is not quite right. Any design starts out as a blank canvas, yet no one is ever paralyzed by choice at the
beginning of design. So why is it that we can find.////

I think what we are ultimately pushing towards is an emotional payoff. What creatives want is not a sense that something is
perfect but a feeling, a feeling that differes from design to design. It might be that feeling that you've accomplished a
clients oals.

So what is the root cause of all this illness? False expectations and purposes, false ideas about what design should be.
And secondarily a false idea that great design is achieved through pursuit of perfection.

I by no means consider myself one of the great designers but I've been great at a few things (world champion at one thing in
fact) and I've talked to allot of great designers. I could write a whole article on this (and actually will). But suffice tit
sto say across the board what lingers through is that great things are not built from a direct jounrney but a rough road of
tweaking and destruction. Great designers are just more experienced at failing.

You need to learn that starting over is not failure, its sucess. Your purpose was not to go to the finish line but to take
the path. It is only by taking the path that you begin to understand the needs of the design. What seperates a great design
from a good design is not hours, not talent, not determination, but the sheer number of restarts, re-winds, breakdowns and
tweaks.

No one has asked why designers are their worst client. Its that

A design starts full of potential but you see every change you make reduces it further. The variability decreases, sometimes
we must go back to go forward. 2

These are Taoist and Zen principles, related to the concept of "the value of undefined" .

As further note anyone who knows me knows I love Eastern Philosophy.
