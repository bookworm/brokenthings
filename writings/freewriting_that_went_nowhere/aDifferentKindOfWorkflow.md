# Towards a different kind of workflow.

I'm a skilled designer but my problem is designs take me too long. Photoshop encourages us to head in the wrong
direction. It encourages us to start with beauty first. Experimentation and finding the correct layout has been replaced with
overlaying your version of eye candy on top of someone elses layout. Templates have taken off, and the premium theme mod
market is exploding. I know this first hand, I survived almost solely on that type of work last year and I know many others
who do the same.

I find myself solely focused on beautifying my design or getting stuck into directions I shouldn't have gone. In his chess
psychology book Rowlso calls this "attachment disorder". When we go to far into something we can have tendency to put the
blinders on. All my designs of late tend to have the tendency of being good in part terrible aon the whole. Great header +
menu, or great product listings but as whole t falters. It seems to be apalgue on dribble, wonc eI see some of these designs
in context I'm like wtf happended?

I want to be a better designer. The ebst designers seem to start with sketches. Why is this? They've learned to avoid getting
creatively locked. In the interest of taking a jab at the article . Skeching s like an architect using a napkin. Its fucked
up medium to be using for something that is digital.

The fact is using the browser is an absolute pain in the ass going back in forth takes more effort than just staying in
photoshop. This is why we see wireframing tools exploding. But wireframing tools are a too far in the wrong direction. A
design should srping from its text & content, then the layouts, then the typography , then the colors, then functionality &
finally beatuy. I feel like wireframes convulted the content process and skip to a pseduo layout phase. I ahte wireframes,
they are like css & html for people who can tdo css & html.

# The Productivity argument

I need to stay in one spot as long as possible cs s& html allow me to do this. I keep keyboaridng for as long as possible and
trasition between photsohop.
