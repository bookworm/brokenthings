Dear Designer Friend,

So Right now I'm staring at my computer screen with one of those blank designer stares. You know the one, it's the one you get after hours of hours of laboring and seemingly no results. I've been doing this for who knows how long now, might be going on something like 5 hours, although it feels like forever. I'm desperately sifting through CSS gallery after looking CSS gallery looking, grasping, reaching, and hoping to run across a site that might bring about an incredible spark of inspiration. My desperation is turning to depression, no matter how hard I try I just can't seem to get this design right. 

I've thrown out element after element in a continuing driven by emotions which are in turn driven by the process which in turn drives the emotions once again. I feel as if the only resolution to this situation is either complete failure or a long and drawn out trudge to the eventual "good enough" result. If the latter occurs I know that one day I'll simply repeat the same horrendous project again.

If this was a painting and I a painter I'd have utterly ruined the work with a can of paint by now. I'd considered throwing the design out and starting a new but web designers are simply not afforded the same freedoms of artistic rage as their artist and musician counterparts. The clients wouldn't simply write such a transgression off as a personality flaw necessary for my genius.

I no doubt have a serious issue, only I don't know what the issue is, I think my creative process is simply fracked up but who knows maybe I'm just a crappy web designer. Some days I feel like taking up car repair or switching to code, my developer friends don't seem nearly as tormented. Perhaps I'll turn to a "real design' like my cool friends and start designing stuffer animals and billboards. Don't heed my words too much, as these are simply the nightmares and dreams of a tormented soul, I know real desire or intentions to quit. Although I am tormented and in love with web design and I'm obsessed like a mathematician who lies awake at night solving the complex equations of atoms. I could never leave no matter how much this project pains me and I know it.               


So here I am once again in the same shitty situation, I cant quit and I don't know if I will survive the journey if I go on. Despite all my previous words I've still have no sense of approaching resolution, much less a scent or hint. My therapist was simply wrong, writing down my problems does not solve them. I think I'll bill him for the missed work hours during which I wrote this crappy e-mail. 

I've tried countless suggested techniques but none seem to work. There is a trend called CSS galleries and I thought I would give that a try first. I've been to CSSmania, Daily Slurp, Patterntap, and at Scrnshots I looked at blurred Asian porn. The CSS galleries provided me with nothing of real value and although the Asian porn was stimulating it was not the sort of stimulation I needed. 


I tried some the alternative methods like looking to nature for inspiration, I journeyed to the local national forest and spent many hours
