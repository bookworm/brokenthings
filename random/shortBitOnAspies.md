Typically people either think that someone wont get sarcasm or that they’re fucking Rain Man. Of course Aspies fall on a wide spectrum & those who are diagnosed are typically on one of the extremes. Aspies (and Schizoids) almost never seek counseling, so they are only diagnosed when it seriously interferes with their ability to function.

But the biggest issue Aspies face is not a misunderstanding about Aspergers, its mis-interpretations of our behavior. We don’t do things for the same reasons that Neuro-typicals do things. I have been accused of being a sociopath, psychopath, insane, an asshole, cold hearted etc.

We are perceived as being depressed when we are focused. Shy when we are just introverted. Compulsive when we are simply obsessive. Inept when we are just oblivious. Assholes when we are just unaware of others.

I often tell people: "it's not that I don’t feel it's that I 'feel differently'." Ultimately feeling differently means expressing my feelings differently.
