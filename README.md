# The intro.

I'm tired of throwing my stuff away after I'm done with it. This repo provides a unique look into a day to day of a developer. I'm happy to receive feedback but keep in mind this is basically a personal notebook; so I'm probably going to be really fucking irritated if you do things like correct my grammar or spelling. 

I have distinct neurological differences from the majority of the human population. For me inputs take different pathways than they do for most people thus my notes are unlikely to make much sense to anyone but me especially out of context. I'm hesitant to apply labels to psychological phenomenon but if you want to dangle with labels I have varying degrees of what might be labelled synesthesia & I cross the asperger's spectrum.
