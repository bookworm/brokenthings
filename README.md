# The intro.

I'm tired of throwing my stuff away after I'm done with it. This repo provides a unique look into a day to day of a developer. I'm happy to receive feedback but keep in mind this is basically a personal notebook; so I'm probably going to be really fucking irritated if you do things like correct my grammar or spelling. 

_Things are unlikely to make sense to you._
