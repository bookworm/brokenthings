Heres how it works. Its subscription based. Authors add theire products in hopes getting part of the subscriptions cut for that cycle the shorter the cylcle the more payouts to authors that month. Each bundle product has desired payout. A simple PSD does not get the same payout as a WordPress theme. 

Everyone signs up & all the authors participating gets periodic cuts of cash when their items are chosen. Its way of creating a permanent community cash pool. The cycles can vary in length.  This means everyone benefits. Subscribing early gets you all the items before that cycle ends. More bang for your buck. Need to be able diagram this visually

Cyclical never ending bundles.

Add stuff to the bundle and it stays in forever. Random thread reaches 100MB bundle begins again. User can buy 1 part of thhead. They get everything until that thread ends. Need some sort of metaphor for this. Perhaps tpaestry of time. It will grow & fucking grow. People who bought into the bundle earlier should garner something. Monies split between bundle items. Random goodies all the time forever.

Items are chosen at random out of the pool of past bundle items.

User need to be able to purchase in ahead of time. Purchasing the bundle once it has already occurs ruin the effect. What do you get for buying in before the next chain starts? I think I got it the chain is slowly seeded until its done. Perhaps it gets more expensive as time passes?

Should be time based. 4 chances a month? 7 items a chain? What encourage users to stay on as permanent member of bundles? Rewards points for each completed chain towards next bundle? 

Perhaps the chain needs upreictalbe beginning that motivates people to bu in. No one will know when next chain starts and ends. When it fills up chain ends && new one starts
