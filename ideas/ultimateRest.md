Alfred like app. Type commands and the results are pushed to matching routes on a configured server.

True REST with crawable details in results can provide automatic API.

`new TODO file arg`

Can document with hints so app knows how to handle things.

Args can be a simple YAML esque language which should be pretty easy to parse.

`new Todo title: Take out trash`

`complete Todo Take Out Trash` # maps to /todos/:id/completee
